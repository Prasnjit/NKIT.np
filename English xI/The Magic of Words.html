                <div class="content">
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">The story starts with a description of Kimberly Clark, the
                        protagonist of the story, who is twenty-five years old with all qualities of a normal young
                        woman. She is pretty, she loves to dance, and she has many friends and a good position in the
                        office of a large company. Despite these all, she has a problem. She has been troubled by a
                        strange and mysterious dream that haunts her every night.<span id="more-23"></span></p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">The strange dream always begins on a country road. Kim stands on
                        this road and sees a lane with a white fence and a hedge on each side. At the end of the lane,
                        on the top of a little hill, she sees a small white cottage with green shutters. Then she walks
                        up the lane to the house, goes in and looks around. In one of the rooms, she finds a man asleep
                        in bed. He is a little old man with white hair and a white beard. When she comes near his bed,
                        the man wakes up. Then he sits up and looks at her. When she tries to speak to him, she wakes
                        up. She is very surprised troubled by the dream because she has never known any little old man
                        like that and neither the place.</p>
                    <!--  -->
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Kim’s roommate knows everything. So, one day she proposes Kim to
                        visit her (Janet’s) parents’ farmhouse to feel peace in mind. As they pass through a country
                        road, Kim sees the similar scene which she sees in her dream. They stop there. Janet does not
                        want Kim to go and see the small cottage but Kim goes.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">The house was exactly the same, except for a sign in front of the
                        house which said ‘FOR SALE’. Unlike her dream, Kim goes to the door of the house and knocks and
                        to her surprise, the same old man answers the door who immediately closes the door. After Kim’s
                        request, he opens the door. Kim again asks why the house is for sale. The old man reveals that
                        the house is haunted by a ghost. Kim tries hard to think to say something instead asks who the
                        ghost is. The old man gets surprised and shocks her by replying that she herself is the ghost.

                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>1. Write about a dream that you have seen
                            recently.</strong><br>Ans: Yesterday I saw a terrible dream about a ghost. In my dream I
                        found myself sitting with my friends in the jungle. When I was a little away from my friends, I
                        saw a ghost dancing around me. It was telling me that I was going to be killed. In my dream, I
                        cried so badly. I was asking for help. My friends did not listen to me what I was saying. I fell
                        in a critical condition. I thought I had to kill the ghost. Then, the fight began between me and
                        the ghost. The ghost had had very sharp claws and red eyes. It was so furious so I was. I tried
                        to thrash it on the stone. Fortunately, I succeeded on my own and the ghost was thrown into the
                        river nearby. Finally, I went to my friends who were looking at me. They asked me how the fight
                        was like. I also narrated the event as it has happened. The next day, the result of my dream
                        came true. I got the first division in the exam.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2. Does dream have any connection to our real life? Discuss
                            your personal view. Also relates to the story. “The Recurring Dreams.”</strong><br>Ans: Of
                        course, dreams have a connection to our real life. I have got such experience in my life. Once I
                        saw my friend Mohan fallen down from a tree in my dream. After a few days, I heard the news that
                        he met an accident. He was rushed to the hospital. His condition became worse. His hands and
                        legs were broken and ultimately died.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>3. Why do some people have recurring dreams? Give your
                            opinion.</strong><br>Ans: Many people have their dreams at night. We have also got some
                        experiences of dreams. In our dreams sometimes we see ghosts, wild animals, great buildings,
                        juggles, death person, friends etc. In my opinion, we see these persons, animals, things because
                        of our unsatisfied desires. We have experienced that what we desire in a daytime, occurs in our
                        dream at night. So desire of getting something might be the cause of recurring dream. In the
                        same way, sometimes we see same dream day by day. We have experienced the fact that we fail in
                        our exam in the dream if we are waiting for the exam result. So fear might be the cause of
                        dream.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>4. Why does Janet want to take Kim to her parent’s farm for
                            a few days?</strong><br>Ans: Janet wants to take her friend to her parents’ farm because Kim
                        had a problem of the recurring dream. She used to see the same old man and the white house in
                        her dream. Kim tried to speak to that old man in her dream but suddenly woke up from her dream.
                        This happened daily. Her friend, Janet wanted to take Kim to her parent’s farm so that Kim will
                        feel easy and forget that recurring dream. So Janet takes Kim to her own parents’ farm for a few
                        days.</p>

        ourselves through dreams. Some people also argue that our spirit visits places and persons related to us in our
        previous life. The movement of spirit comes to us like a dream.
        <br>In the story ‘Recurring Dream’, a normal lady, named Kim has a dream about a person and a place,
        which she has never seen before. She has this dream almost every night. In her dream, she always finds herself
        on a
        country road. There, she sees a lane leading to a cottage. She finds an old man with white hair and a beard in
        one
        of the rooms. When she tries to talk to him, she wakes up. Surprisingly, she sees the same place and the same
        man
        while she is going to in the cottage Janet’s parents’ farm. It is so mysterious that the old man accuses Kim of
        being a ghost and visiting his house. Maybe the old man is connected to Kim previous life.

    <p class="justify has-medium-font-size"><strong>11. <strong><strong>What do you think is the reason some people have
                    recurring dreams?</strong></strong></strong><br><em><strong>Ans:</strong> </em>Some people have
        recurring dreams because of their problems and unfulfilled wishes. When a certain problem troubles us
        constantly, we feel stressed even when we are asleep. As a result, we may have a dream related to it. Moreover,
        if we cannot fulfil our desire, in reality, we may satisfy ourselves through dreams. Thus, dreams are related to
        deep wishes.</p>




    <p class="justify has-medium-font-size"><strong>12. <strong><strong>Why do you think Kim has this
                    dream?</strong></strong></strong><br><em><strong>Ans:</strong> </em>I think Kim has this dream
        because of the unfulfilled wishes of her past life. She might have had a desire to meet her grandfather. But she
        might have died before meeting him. The old man could be her grandfather. Therefore, her spirit might have
        visited the house of the old man.</p>

                    the ending of the story).</strong></strong></strong><br><em><strong>Ans:</strong> </em>The story
        does not say how she enters the house because only her spirit visits the house and spirits are never obstructed

                    she tries to speak to the man in her dream?</strong></strong></strong><br><em><strong>Ans:</strong>
        </em>In my opinion, Kim wakes up because she is only a spirit when she is with the old man. The spirit cannot
        speak. When she tries to say something, she goes back to her human form. Speaking involves physical activity but
        physically she is in her bed in London.</p>

                of yours or of <em>someone you know.</em></strong></strong><br><strong>Ans:</strong> I still remember
        the strange dream I had four months ago. It was a dream about a place I had never seen before.<br>As usual, I
        had gone to bed at 10:30. In no time. I found myself with a group of friends on the village road. There were
        pine trees and tea gardens on each side of the road. After some time, a bus appeared there out of nowhere. We
        all ran to get on the bus. The bus headed towards the hill. There were a number of bends, but we safely reached
        the top of the hill. We could see a green forest, stretching far up to the plains. Around us were tea plants in
        rows. The rose bushes made the place look very beautiful. Soon we found ourselves in a hotel. There, a girl of
        about twenty served us tea and fried rice. While we were eating, there was a big landslide. We ran here and
        there in terror. As I was crying, I woke up. Although I realized it was a dream, my heartbeat for a long time.
        <br>Last week, I went to Illam with my friends. After we had crossed ‘Charlie’ the scenery was very beautiful.
        There were tea estates, pine tree on either side of the road. The road was similar to the one I had seen in my
        dream. As we reached ‘Harkate’ and started taking our breakfast in a hotel, it reminded me of the dream I had
        some months ago. The beautiful tea estates, evergreen forest, hills there made me feel that I had already been
        familiar to that place.

        Everybody dreams. However, dreams have still remained mysterious experience. Psychologists like Freud wrote
        volumes of books, and classified, and interpreted dreams. However, there is no convincing explanation even
        today. I don’t find a special meaning in dreams. Some of my friends tell me that their dreams come true. Once,
        one of my friends told me he had a dream that his three-year-old son was chased by a buffalo. After a week, he
        came to me with eyes filled with tears. His son had died. Another friend of mine told me that his house caught
        fire after he had seen a dream. In his dream, he had seen a burning forest.</p>
